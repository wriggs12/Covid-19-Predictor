[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/made-with-java.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)


This project collects data on the Covid-19 pandemic and uses basic statistics to generate an acceptable prediction. 
The defualt date is set to March 1st, 2021. 
To change the date, go to line 30 and replace the dates with desired dates.

To generate the predictions I am using the first and second rates of change and continuing the patern as observed through these rates of change.

For reliable, quick, and free acces to data I am using the Covid Tracking Project API.
